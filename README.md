Final project for **Technologies of Internet and Web Development** course (_Erasmus_ semester), developing a **web page** for an e-commerce (musical records in this case) using **HTML5**, **CSS3**, **PHP** and **JavaScript** (with _jQuery_) to implement _AJAX_ techniques to offer a better user experience, not having to reload each time a new page but updating directly the DOM.
